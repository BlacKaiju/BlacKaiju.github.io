Hello everybody and thanks for stopping by!!!

Welcome to my personal portfolio website.
A majority of the projects on this site are FreeCodeCamp projects. There are a few that I've thought up and built myself.

What makes me want to become a web developer/software engineer is the fact that my old occupation as an entertainment worker
didn't give back as much as I initially thought it would. I want to work in an industry that contributes to the world in a more constructive 
and profound way. I've seen what coding can do for people from medical to gaming and I want to be apart of that.

I hope you enjoy what you see!
Any feedback is much appreciated!
